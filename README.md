# bakery_app
The aim of this app is to optymailize 
the manual work of a bakery worker, who prepares the daily production list of bread for bakers 
(this work takes about one hour a day and is exposed to random human errors).

The usual tasks of bakery worker:
-print a file from a special program with production description for grocery stores,
-Rewrite it into the notebook and add two rows with production for doorstep sale,
-sum all items up, and rewrite again on paper for bakers.

The app shortens the working time about 90%.
Worker has to only load the file from a special program, 
choose the day of production and make eventual corrections.
